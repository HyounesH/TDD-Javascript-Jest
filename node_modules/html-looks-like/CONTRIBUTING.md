## Please note

I may or may not have time to improve this library. I'm making it public because I want others to simply have access to it if need be. If you want to submit a pull request, it is essential that you first submit an issue to discuss with the maintainer if it is worth making a PR. This is for your own sake, as you may waste your own time making a PR that may not be merged.
